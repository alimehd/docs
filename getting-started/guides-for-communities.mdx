## Welcome

This guide is designed to help other Indigenous communities understand how Heritage Lab builds language tools and how you can adapt our approach for your own community's needs.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in building language tools for your community, here are some key areas to consider:

### Community Engagement

<Info>
Community involvement is essential at every stage of development.
</Info>

- **Identify community needs**: Work with language speakers, elders, and community members to understand what tools would be most valuable
- **Build partnerships**: Establish relationships with language programs, schools, and cultural organizations
- **Respect protocols**: Follow community protocols for working with language materials and cultural knowledge

### Technical Considerations

- **Data sovereignty**: Ensure your community maintains control over language data
- **Accessibility**: Design tools that are accessible to community members of all technical skill levels
- **Offline capabilities**: Consider that many communities may have limited or unreliable internet access

### Governance

- **Language Committee**: Establish a committee structure to guide decision-making
- **Data policies**: Develop clear policies around data retention, sharing, and sovereignty
- **Community ownership**: Ensure the community maintains ownership and control of tools and data
