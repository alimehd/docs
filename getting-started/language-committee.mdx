## Overview

The Language Committee serves as the cornerstone of Heritage Lab's commitment to linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity, providing essential guidance on all aspects of the Ai! platform's language development to ensure our technology truly serves communities.

## Inuktitut Language Committee

The Inuktitut Language Committee is composed of Inuit language experts and community members who provide guidance on all aspects of Inuktitut language technology development.

### Current Members

Lisa Mesher, Natasha Ita MacDonald, Thomassie Mangiok, Harriet Keleutak, Eva Ilisituk, Tukirqi Pilurtuut, Jeannie Nayoumealuk, and Shaun Annanack

## Role and Responsibilities

The Committee provides guidance on dialectical variations across regions, reviews and approves language content before AI implementation, establishes standards for linguistic quality and cultural appropriateness, and advises on grammar rules and implementation strategies. The Committee guides critical decisions about how dialectal variations should be represented in AI systems, which linguistic resources and grammar rules should be prioritized, cultural appropriateness of generated content, translation standards and approaches, and methods for handling specialized terminology.

## Meetings

The Committee meets bi-monthly (six meetings annually) for approximately 3-4 hours per meeting. Meetings are primarily virtual with at least one in-person gathering annually. Paid review work is available as needed between meetings.

## Decision-Making

The committee strives for consensus in decision-making where all members have equal voice in discussions. Decisions respect community protocols and values. Meeting minutes are maintained and shared with committee members, and decisions are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.

## Compensation

Committee members receive honoraria for their time and expertise. Travel and accommodation expenses are covered for in-person meetings.

## Recognition

Committee members are acknowledged for their contributions to the Ai! initiative. Their expertise directly shapes technology that preserves language for future generations, creating digital tools that respect dialectal diversity and cultural authenticity.
