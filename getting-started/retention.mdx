## Overview

This policy outlines how Heritage Lab handles the retention and deletion of language data and other information collected in the course of our work with Indigenous communities.

## Retention Principles

### Community-Driven Retention

- **Community control**: Communities determine how long their data should be retained
- **Flexible policies**: Retention periods can be customized based on community needs and preferences
- **Regular review**: We conduct regular reviews with communities about data retention

### Purpose-Based Retention

Data is retained only as long as necessary for:

- The purposes for which it was collected (as agreed with the community)
- Legal or regulatory requirements
- Ongoing community language programs and initiatives

## Retention Periods

### Language Data

- **Active projects**: Data is retained for the duration of active language projects
- **Inactive projects**: Communities can choose to retain data indefinitely, archive it, or request deletion
- **Minimum retention**: We maintain data for a minimum period to ensure community access, unless deletion is explicitly requested

### Administrative Data

- **Project records**: Retained for the duration of the project plus a reasonable period for record-keeping
- **Communication records**: Retained according to community preferences and legal requirements
- **Financial records**: Retained according to legal and regulatory requirements

## Data Deletion

### Community-Requested Deletion

- Communities can request deletion of their data at any time
- Deletion requests are processed promptly, typically within 30 days
- We confirm deletion in writing to the requesting community

### Automatic Deletion

- Data may be automatically deleted after agreed-upon retention periods expire
- Communities are notified before automatic deletion occurs
- Communities can request extension of retention periods

### Secure Deletion

- Deleted data is securely removed from all systems
- Backups containing deleted data are also removed according to our backup retention policy
- We maintain records of deletion requests for audit purposes

## Backup and Archive

### Backups

- Regular backups are maintained for data protection
- Backup retention follows the same principles as primary data retention
- Communities are informed about backup practices

### Archives

- Communities can choose to archive their data for long-term preservation
- Archived data is stored securely and separately from active data
- Archive access is controlled by the community

## Special Considerations

### Cultural Materials

- Special care is taken with culturally sensitive materials
- Retention and deletion of cultural materials follows community protocols
- Additional protections may apply to ceremonial or restricted materials

### Legal Requirements

- Some data may need to be retained longer due to legal or regulatory requirements
- Communities are informed about any legal retention obligations
- We work with communities to balance legal requirements with data sovereignty principles
