description: "Heritage Lab's principles and timeframes for data retention, storage, and disposal"
---

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the principles and timeframes for how Heritage Lab retains, stores, and disposes of data. Our primary goal is to respect community ownership and Indigenous data sovereignty, guided by the principles of OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession). This policy ensures we are compliant with local privacy laws (such as Quebec's Law 25) and accountable to our partners and contributors.

<Info>
Heritage Lab firmly asserts that it owns its technology, platforms, and IP, but it does not own the community data it stores or processes.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all data processed and stored by Heritage Lab, which is divided into two main categories:

- **Community-Contributed Data** (For the Search Tool)
- **AI Language Model Data** (For the Translation Tool & Language Learning)

## 3. Data Storage

All data managed by Heritage Lab will be stored by default at a secure, Indigenous-controlled data centre (e.g., Kahnawà:ke) to ensure Indigenous data security and sovereignty is maintained.

Partner communities have the option to store their data on their own servers. In such cases, Heritage Lab will assist in the setup to ensure the storage solution meets the necessary security and sovereignty standards to protect the data and platform integrity.

## 4. Retention Periods and Disposal

### 4.1 Community-Contributed Data (Search Tool)

This category includes stories, historical information, and other materials submitted by individual users or partner organizations for use in a search tool (e.g., Ayaguta).

**Principle**: This data is used by a retrieval system. The information from the source will never be changed, generated, or reformatted.

**Ownership**: This data remains the property of the individual or organization that contributed it.

**Retention Period**: Data is retained indefinitely unless informed permission is revoked.

**Disposal (Right to Revoke)**: A user has the right to revoke permission for their story or piece of information at any time. Upon receiving a revocation request, Heritage Lab will permanently delete the specified data from the platform. Partner organizations also have the right to request their data be removed.

### 4.2 AI Language Model Data (Training)

This category includes public data and non-public data used to train the AI language model.

**Principle**: This data is used to teach the AI how to speak, understand, and translate a language.

**Retention Period (Source Files)**:

- **Public Data**: Publicly sourced data used for training is retained as part of the training corpus. The list of these sources is confidential and proprietary to Heritage Lab.
- **Non-Public Partner Data**: Non-public documents are sometimes used for the specific purpose of training the AI model. These source files are retained only for the duration specified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or contract with the partner.

**Retention Period (The AI Model)**:

The resulting AI model is an asset.

- If the model is for a specific community or regional project, that community owns the model file.
- If the model is part of Heritage Lab's core technology, it is owned by Heritage Lab and is retained indefinitely.

**Disposal**: Non-public source files used for training will be securely destroyed once the training is complete and validated, or as per the terms of the partner MOU.

## 5. Data Deletion

### Community-Requested Deletion

- Communities and individual users can request deletion of their data at any time
- Deletion requests are processed promptly, typically within 30 days
- We confirm deletion in writing to the requesting community or individual
- For Community-Contributed Data, users have the right to revoke permission and request permanent deletion

### Secure Deletion

- Deleted data is securely removed from all systems
- Backups containing deleted data are also removed according to our backup retention policy
- We maintain records of deletion requests for audit purposes
- Non-public source files used for AI training are securely destroyed after training completion or as per MOU terms

## 6. Backup and Archive

### Backups

- Regular backups are maintained for data protection
- Backup retention follows the same principles as primary data retention
- Communities are informed about backup practices
- Backups are stored at secure, Indigenous-controlled data centres

### Archives

- Communities can choose to archive their data for long-term preservation
- Archived data is stored securely and separately from active data
- Archive access is controlled by the community
- Community-Contributed Data may be archived indefinitely unless permission is revoked

## 7. Special Considerations

### Cultural Materials

- Special care is taken with culturally sensitive materials
- Retention and deletion of cultural materials follows community protocols
- Additional protections may apply to ceremonial or restricted materials
- Communities determine appropriate handling of cultural content

### Legal Requirements

- Some data may need to be retained longer due to legal or regulatory requirements (such as Quebec's Law 25)
- Communities are informed about any legal retention obligations
- We work with communities to balance legal requirements with data sovereignty principles
- Compliance with local privacy laws is maintained while respecting OCAP principles

## 8. Policy Review

This Data Retention Policy will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors to ensure it remains aligned with Heritage Lab's mission, technological capabilities, and legal obligations.
