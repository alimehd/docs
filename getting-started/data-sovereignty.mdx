# **Heritage Lab Data Sovereignty Policy**

***Developed by the Data Sovereignty Working Group:***  
*Lisa Mesher, Natasha Ita MacDonald, Thomassie Mangiok, Robin Anawak, consultation with Abundant Intelligences including Fenwick McKelvey and Maroussia Lévesque*

## **Purpose** 

Heritage Lab is an Indigenous-led, values-driven organization committed to advancing AI development in alignment with Indigenous data sovereignty principles. Technology development is not neutral—it is a process of community governance and an articulation of sovereignty. This policy ensures that Indigenous communities maintain control over their knowledge, languages, and cultural heritage as they engage with artificial intelligence and digital technologies.

This policy protects Indigenous rights to ownership and control over data while establishing clear, ethical standards for how Heritage Lab develops and deploys AI tools in partnership with Indigenous communities.

## **5\. Data Governance by Category**

Heritage Lab treats different kinds of data differently based on their purpose and community agreements.

### **5.1 Community-Contributed Content**

**Examples**: Ayaguta Search Tool submissions \- stories, historical information, cultural knowledge

**How we handle this data**:

* **Closed-loop retrieval system**: We use a retrieval system that references trusted sources and community contributions without modifying, generating, or reformatting the original information  
* **Ownership and attribution**: Contributors retain full ownership with rights to attribution or anonymity  
* **Review process**: Submissions undergo review before inclusion  
* **Retention**: Indefinite, unless permission is revoked  
* **Right to revoke**: Contributors may request removal at any time; Heritage Lab will permanently delete within 30 days  
* **Citation**: All sources are always cited; tools provide reference material, not generated content

### **5.2 AI Language Model Training Data**

**Purpose**: Linguistic data used to train translation and language learning AI models

**Data sources**:

**Public Data**:

* Publicly available materials (social media, websites, published documents)  
* Used to teach AI models linguistic patterns  
* Retention: Retained as part of training corpus for model improvement

**Partner Data**:

* Non-public documents provided by Partners specifically for AI training  
* Requires a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) specifying:  
  * Exact data to be used  
  * Retention period for source files  
  * Model ownership (community owns model file for community-specific projects)  
  * Right to request data removal and model retraining  
* Retention: Only for duration specified in MOU  
* Automatic deletion upon MOU expiry unless renewed  
* Data transferred or deleted if contract is terminated—Heritage Lab does not retain data after agreement ends

### **5.3 AI Model Files**

**Governance**:

* Language Committee provides oversight for model updates and improvements
