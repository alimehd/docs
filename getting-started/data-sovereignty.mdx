## Our Commitment

Heritage Lab is committed to upholding Indigenous data sovereignty principles. We recognize that language data belongs to the communities from which it originates, and we work to ensure that communities maintain control, ownership, and governance over their data.

## Core Principles

### Community Ownership

- **Data belongs to communities**: All language data collected or processed by Heritage Lab remains the property of the originating community
- **Community control**: Communities have the right to determine how their data is used, stored, and shared
- **No unauthorized use**: We do not use community data for purposes not explicitly approved by the community

### Informed Consent

- **Clear communication**: We provide clear information about how data will be used before collection
- **Ongoing consent**: Communities can withdraw consent or modify data use agreements at any time
- **Transparency**: We maintain transparency about data processing, storage, and sharing practices

### Data Protection

- **Security**: We implement strong security measures to protect community data
- **Access controls**: Only authorized community members and designated Heritage Lab staff have access to community data
- **Compliance**: We follow relevant privacy laws and regulations, including those specific to Indigenous data

## Implementation

### Data Collection

- All data collection requires explicit community approval
- Communities determine what data can be collected and how
- Collection methods respect community protocols and cultural practices

### Data Storage

- Data is stored securely with appropriate access controls
- Communities can request copies of their data at any time
- Storage locations and methods are disclosed to communities

### Data Sharing

- No data is shared with third parties without explicit community consent
- Communities control who can access their data
- Data sharing agreements are clearly documented

## Community Rights

Communities working with Heritage Lab have the right to:

- **Access**: Request access to all data collected from their community
- **Correction**: Request corrections to inaccurate data
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of their data
- **Portability**: Receive their data in a portable format
