Heritage Lab is committed to protecting your privacy and upholding Indigenous data sovereignty. This guide explains how we handle your information.

## Account & Login

**Do I need an account?**  
No. Most of the platform is accessible without logging in. You only need an account for features requiring specific permissions, such as the translation tool.

**How do I sign up?**  
Sign in with your Google or Microsoft account. Authentication is handled securely through Auth0—we never see or store your password.

**How do I delete my account?**  
Go to your user profile and click "Delete Account." Your data will be retained for 6 months, then permanently removed.

## What We Collect

When you log in, we store:
- Username and display name
- Email address and verification status
- Login timestamps

Additional information may be collected if you contribute content, use the contact form, or access translation services.

## How We Use Your Data

Your information is used to:
- Manage your account and permissions
- Enable access to language tools
- Communicate important platform updates

**We do not:**
- Use your data to train AI models
- Store your translation queries
- Use targeted advertising
- Use third-party analytics

## Our Tools

### Translation Tool
Translation requests are processed by our AI models but **not stored**. Access requires approval and is protected by authorization tokens. Requests and responses through certain tools may be audited on the Heritage Lab side.

### OCR Tool
Our OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool runs **entirely on your device**. No images or text are uploaded to our servers—your data never leaves your browser.

## Content Contributions

Anyone can submit content through the dictionary, historical stories, or Ayaguta. All submissions are reviewed by Heritage Lab Administration before publication.

**Your rights as a contributor:**
- You retain ownership of your submissions
- You can request removal at any time by contacting support@heritagelab.ca
- Requests are reviewed by the language committee at their next meeting

## Data Security

- Hosted on Indigenous-controlled infrastructure in Kahnawà:ke, Quebec, Canada
- Authentication secured through Auth0
- Protected by comprehensive security tools and monitoring

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty

Heritage Lab is committed to Indigenous data sovereignty. Language committees maintain decision-making authority over their language projects, including access to translation models, terminology databases, and platform features. Our Data Sovereignty Working Group continues to develop and refine these policies.

## Cookies

We use cookies only for login and session management—nothing else.
