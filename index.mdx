## About Heritage Lab

Heritage Lab is an organization dedicated to building tools and resources that support Indigenous language preservation, revitalization, and community empowerment.

## Our Mission

We believe that language is fundamental to cultural identity and community well-being. Our tools are designed with Indigenous communities at the center, ensuring that technology serves the needs and values of the people who use it.
